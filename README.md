# Simon Game
Implementation of the Simon Game by Hasbro.

# Rules
The Simon Game is a memory game where you click buttons in a shown sequence.
After each round a new button press is added to the sequence, and you are not reminded of the existing sequence - it's all up to you to remember the order of button presses!

You lose if you click any button out of sequence.
