# Simon Game
Implementation of the Simon game by Hasbro, a memory game where you click buttons in a shown sequence.
After each round a new button press is added to the sequence, and you are not reminded of the existing sequence.

You lose if you click any button out of sequence.

Original template by Angela Yu, as part of her Web Development Bootcamp course.
