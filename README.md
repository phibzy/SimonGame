# SimonGame
Implementation of the Simon game by Hasbro, a memory game where you click buttons in a shown sequence.
After each round a new button press is added to the sequence, and you are not reminded of the existing sequence.

Original template by Angela Yu, as part of her Web Development Bootcamp course.
